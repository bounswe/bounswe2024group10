## Changes from the Previous Milestone
Based on previous milestones, our team implemented several changes to improve the development process. One significant improvement was optimizing the backend to make the application faster. This included adding new endpoints and ensuring the backend completed its tasks earlier, giving the frontend team more time to connect with and test API endpoints effectively.

Additionally, we avoided making last-minute changes, which significantly reduced the risk of breaking something critical right before deadlines. This was achieved by thoroughly planning every step in advance and prioritizing robust testing during development.

Another key improvement was enhancing communication within the team. We ensured that everyone stayed aligned on goals and progress, which minimized misunderstandings and improved collaboration. Collectively, these changes led to smoother development cycles, higher-quality deliverables, and an overall more efficient project workflow.
## Reflections and Lessons Learned

Reflecting on our Final Milestone Demo, we gained valuable insights and lessons from the feedback:

1. **User Information Visibility**  
   Users were unable to identify others beyond profile pictures, resulting in lost information. This highlighted the importance of designing interfaces that make key user details readily visible.

2. **Data Structure and Presentation**  
   While Wikidata was used effectively for assets, subform parts lacked similar support. Additionally, timestamps embedded within text made them less accessible, emphasizing the importance of presenting such information in distinct formats for clarity.

3. **Dynamic Features and Historical Data**  
   The dynamic nature of the news was well-received; however, the absence of historical data for assets pointed to an area where a broader perspective could have enriched the experience.

4. **Search Functionality**  
   The search feature for assets lacked semantic capabilities, it is hardcoded. This limited its usability, and incorporating semantic search, possibly leveraging Wikidata, could have made it far more powerful.

5. **Tags and Annotations**  
   Tags, being derived directly from user-generated text, lacked semantic depth. Annotations, especially on mobile, were unavailable, and requiring users to click to view them diminished usability. Displaying annotations directly could have enhanced the user experience significantly.

This milestone taught us the importance of designing for clarity, accessibility, and semantic richness. While we were unable to address these aspects within the scope of the project, the lessons learned provide a foundation for improving similar projects in the future.

## What could have been done differently

During our project, we had some setbacks including both minor and major ones as a team. Our first -and probably the foremost- issue was the general time management & effort distribution during the project. Most of our contributions were provided just some days ago between our major milestones (Customer Presentation 1,2; and the Final Milestone) and other times our repository was much more stable. Our overall effort can be more equally distributed which would provide a constant ongoing progess to the project, as well as establishing more harmony between our subteams (web, mobile, and backend) and lower our stress accordingly. 

Another thing we might have done differently is the communication & progress tracking inside and in-between frontend and backend teams. At some parts of the project, the frontend teams were way ahead of the backend team, which resulted in a rush at the backend team trying to provide necessary endpoints to the frontend teams, while frontend teams were at the same time trying to connect their pages to these endpoints; and when everything was combined with code bugs and lack of time, things did not go very well for us unfortunately. Some other things which can be done differently include more equal task distribution inside our subteams, using GitHub in a more effective manner, etc.

## W3C Standard - Annotations

-   **Standard Adoption**:  
    We adopted the **W3C Web Annotation Data Model** to structure annotations, ensuring compliance with international web standards.
    
-   **Annotation Features**:
    
    -   Users can annotate text within posts and comments.
    -   Annotations are displayed contextually on the right-hand side of the screen for easy accessibility.
    -   Both posts and comments can have multiple annotations, allowing users to highlight and discuss specific parts.
-   **Backend Implementation**:
    
    -   The backend was designed to handle storing and retrieving annotations as JSON-LD (Linked Data).
    -   Annotations are linked to specific posts or comments using unique identifiers.
    -   RESTful endpoints for annotation CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations were developed.
-   **Frontend Integration**:
    
    -   A user-friendly annotation tool was integrated into the post/comment view. Users can select text and create an annotation with a simple interface.
    -   Annotations are displayed in a sidebar, showing details such as the selected text, user who created the annotation, and any associated comments.
-   **Real-Time Updates**:
    
    -   Annotations are synced in real time using WebSockets. Users viewing a post can see new annotations without refreshing the page.
-   **Permissions and Visibility**:
    
    -   Annotations are user-specific, with options to make them public or private.
    -   Public annotations are visible to all users, fostering collaborative discussions.
    -   Private annotations are restricted to the user who created them.
-   **Use Cases**:
    
    -   Highlighting key points in financial analyses.
    -   Adding clarifications or insights to specific phrases in posts.
    -   Enhancing discussions with targeted feedback or questions.

- On the APK, I was constantly ecountering with the error that blocks our http requests to backend API. I researched and found that this is a new security measure for the new Android versions. So it was blocking http and forcing https for each network requests. Solution was to modify the application config so that android will allow our app to use http on the requests.
- Introducing skeleton loaders in the UI enhanced the perceived performance and user experience by providing immediate visual feedback during loading times.
- The addition of rich post content features, such as tag detail pages and post references, improved the app's functionality, making it more dynamic and user-centric.
The refactored navigation structure not only simplified user journeys but also gave a user consistency across different parts of the application.
- **One Mistake I made**: On the refactor branch, I, unintentionally, pushed some improvements that should have been opened as a seperate PR. Even the improvements were not huge, it would be more convenient to have them in seperate PRs.

### Additional Information
  * Throughout the development process, I demonstrated a high level of effort and responsibility. I consistently responded to issues as soon as possible, ensuring the teamâs progress was not hindered. Despite my efforts to foster collaboration and maintain project timelines, some team members were less responsible in their roles. Their lack of accountability often limited our potential to make the forum even better. Additionally, our backend team showed a lack of responsibility at times, requiring frontend members to step in and contribute to the implementation of services. Nevertheless, I took initiative to address these gaps and ensured that the project met its essential goals.

### Additional Information
 Because team wanted to prepare all requirements to final as soon as possible, experienced people worked on code related parts more. I have tried to get some parts but frontend wanted endpoints completely accurate with no error, they did not want to spend time on error corrections. As a result of this, there was an injustice separating tasks in backend. I have done my best in code part in this situation, and worked on documentation.
