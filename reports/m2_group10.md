### 1.2.2 UX design

For the UX design, our main principles are as follows; providing a cross-compatible environment between various devices, creating a scalable UX design, while also providing fundamental privacy and security measurements. It should be easily usable for users who are not familiar to our application, and should provide quick access for main features, such as profile access, search functionality access, etc.

About the domain-specific parts of our UX design, we designed our application-specific parts' UX designs in a proper manner. For example, at the "Public Portfolio Browsing" part, our decision is to allow users to view public portfolios, including asset choices and performance metrics. Another example can be the "Personalized News Feed", where we decided to design a personalized news feed that aggregates trending articles based on user-selected financial assets. Other domain-specific UX design decisions include:

- Portfolio Performance Monitoring -> Providing real-time performance updates and notifications for public portfolios and related comments
- User Tags and Networking -> Enabling selection of user tags (e.g., Day Trader, Financial Analyst) to personalize the experience and connect with users of similar interests
- Advanced Search with Tagging -> Develop an advanced search that prioritizes results based on tags like "emerging markets" and "tech stocks"
- Tag System for Scannability -> Highlighting tags such as "Trending" or "Top Performers" within public portfolios

More details are provided in [User Experience (UX) Decisions](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/wiki/User-Experience-Decisions) where we have considered two basic application usage scenarios and wrote corresponding UX decisions, both general and domain-specific ones.

### 1.2.3 Description of the standard being utilized

For our project, we planned to use the "W3C Web Annotation Data Model" as our main standard. This standard allows users to annotate specific parts of a document or multimedia content on the web, such as highlighting text, adding comments, or attaching external resources. It defines a structured format for annotations, making them interoperable across platforms and tools. For more details, see [W3C Standard ‚Äê Annotation](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/wiki/W3C-Standard-%E2%80%90-Annotation)

### 1.2.4 API Documentation

(will be written)

## 1.3 Testing

### 1.3.1 General test plan

About our general testing plan, we divided it into subparts, which will be explained below:

1-) Unit testing: Unit testing is essential for software development because it ensures the quality, reliability, and maintainability of our codebase. As a team, we are planning to write unit tests for all sensitive areas inside our code. Also, each team member will write at least one unit test for our application. Some important parts about the unit test include:

- Account Management System
- Posts System
  - Search Functionality
  - Subforum Management System
  - Privacy and Personalization
  - Financial Asset Integration
  - Portfolio Endpoints

2-) Integration testing: Integration testing is also a crucial part of our software, as it verifies that different modules or components of an application work together as expected. While unit tests focus on individual components in isolation, integration tests ensure the harmony and functionality of interconnected parts. We are also planning to separate the integration tests among our team members as well. Some important parts about the unit test include:

- Account and Authentication System
- Portfolio Sharing and Privacy
- Posts and Comments
- Financial Asset Integration
- Subforum Management System

3-) Mock data: In order to demonstrate our application's backend connections in Customer Presentation 2, we have written a basic mock data for our application. For the Final Milestone, we are planning to expand our mock data (implemented in our backend server, not in frontend) and making it more sophisticated; including many users, their posts, comments, assets, followings and followers, etc.

More details can be found in [Unit Test Plan](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/wiki/Milestone-2-plan#unit-test-plan), [Integration Test Plan](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/wiki/Milestone-2-plan#integration-test-plan)

### 1.3.2 Generated unit test report

- Unfortunately, we were not able to generate a unit test report for Customer Presentation 2, so we are planning to generate all necessary unit test reports until the Final Presentation.

## 1.4 Planning and Team Process

### 1.4.1 Changes made or will be made (after Milestone 1)

Until Milestone 1, our main focus was on implementing necessary pages for frontend, as we weren't have to use our mock data from the backend. Accordingly, as the frontend teams (web and mobile) have finished most of their pages until Customer Presentation 1, our focus was shifted to implementing the necessary backend endpoints and providing necessary frontend-backend connections at the time between Customer Presentation 1 and 2. However, due to some time management and communication issues, we were not able to either implement all endpoints properly, or connect corresponding pages to related endpoints correctly. Consequently, we still have some missing parts both at the backend and at the frontend. For the final customer presentation, our main goal is to close up our missing parts at the implementation part (both backend and frontend), and implement our decided web standard (W3C Annotation)

### 1.4.2 Plan for completing our project

As explained in 1.4.1, we still have some missing parts at the backend as well as the frontend. Our first plan is to understand our mistakes and take lessons from them. As explained in 1.4.1, we had both time and communication related issues, and to provide a solution, we are planning to spread our work into time instead of leaving all tasks at the very last minute; while also providing better frontend-backend communication during the implementation stage. An idea for this is to instead of letting frontend and backend doing their tas in a "discrete" mannner (eg. backend implements an endpoint, informs the frontend, frontend takes the endpoint and tries to connect it to a page, gets an error, informs the backend, then backend tries to debug it, informs the frontend after debugging, the frontend checks it once again, and so on...), we can somehow join their tasks by letting (at least) one person from backend and frontend do their related tasks in parallel under a better communication environment (either face to face, or in an online meeting, etc.); which might drastically improve our task completion speed as well as compatability between frontend and backend.

About the web standard implementation part, it is also as task which is related to both backend and frontend teams. Consequently, a possible approach is to assign 2-3 people (at least 1 person from frontend and backend) from our team to the "web standard implementation" task; where they will first understand the core mechanism of the related standard, then go to the imlementation stage. With better time management and communication, we believe that all these plans will come true and we would be able to successfully finalize our application with all the necessary requirements.

## 1.5 Evaluation

### 1.5.1 Summary of the customer feedback and reflections

During our Customer Presentation 2, we had some valuable feedbacks from both our professor as well as our teaching assistants. It was told that our presentation was overall good, however we had some missing parts. First of all, we had not done anything about the web standard part, so we have to complete necessary parts about the web standard implementation until the Final Presentation. Also, while showing our assets page, our professor told that instead of only showing the company name abbreviations at the related page, we can also show a brief introduction text for each company listed as well as what each company abbreviation stands for; which would provide the customer an ease of use with a better understanding about these companies. Specifically about the web standard part, our professor told that we first have to really understand the core mechanism of the related web standard, how it should work in principle, and how it can be adapted to our application; and only after understanding that mechanism very well we should implement it with our application (our web standard should be somewhat independent from our application as it is a general standard rather than an application-specific one). We took notes during the Customer Feedback 2 and our plan is to imply the points mentioned during our presentation into our application accordingly.

### 1.5.2 Evaluation of the status of deliverables

Excluding our "User Group Scenarios" and "Lab PRs & Meeting Notes", the status of our main three deliverables are explained below:
1-) Our software: As explained before, our current software has some missing parts both at the backend and frontend, as well as not having anything about the web standard except the choice and plan for the web standard. Until the Final Presentation, we are planning to complete the missing parts at the frontend and backend, while also understanding and implementing the related web standard for our application.

2-) UX Decisions: During the frontend implementation stage, we tried to follow the basic UX decisions explained [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/wiki/User-Experience-Decisions), however there might be some missing parts. Until the Final Presentation, our plan is to completely follow our explained UX guidelines and provide a smooth user experience in our application.

3-) W3C Standard Decision & Implementation : As said above, we only have made the decision about which standard will be implemented, explained some general properties about the related standard, and a basic plan for the implementation stage. Until the Final Milestone, our plan is to deeply understand the main mechanism of our standard, and after that properly implement the standard for our application.

### 1.5.3 Evaluation of tools and processes used

1.5.1 Diagrams
For creating the sequence diagrams we used the Mermaid language. Learning it was quite easy since the [tutorial](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html) for creating sequence diagrams with it is really clear. Also the language itself is optimal for creating the sequence diagrams because the creator writes the codes downwards in the same order as the messages and replies as the diagram thus making it easy to follow the flow.

However, for creating the use case diagram and the class diagram we used draw.io since it was easier to handle the many connections/relations between elements by drawing it by hand, moreover creating more complex connection based diagrams is easier if the creator can see the big picture while creating the diagram because they can avoid mistakes better.

1.5.2. Communication
Our main communication channel was Whatsapp because everyone can immediately see a message, which helps in urgent scenerios. We also used independent subgroup Whatsapp channels to communicate subgroup related things. Moreover, by listening to the feedback, we started using issues more actively, using them for discussion spaces helped us focus on topics clearly and follow the progress of each task.

1.5.3. Project Plan
For the project plan we used ProjectLibre. ProjectLibre makes adding tasks and interdependencies and seeing the order of tasks really easy. Moreover, being able to add tasks while seeing the chart itself makes it easier to follow the flow while creating it.

Teammates can easily review their old works, worked with whom and how much time spent while doing the work. Here is the [link](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/wiki/Project-Plan-%E2%80%90-Tradeverse) for screenshots of the plan, here is the [link](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/blob/main/Tradeverse-App%20Project%20Plan.pod) for the code.

1.5.4. Backend Framework
We used Java Spring for our backend framework, decision was almost unanimous, because most members were more experienced in Java's class structure rather than Python's. Also the team members who are knowledgable in Java Spring were able to teach the other backend subgroup members' the ropes effectively.

1.5.5. Database
For the database MySQL was chosen unanimously over PostgreSQL thanks to its ease of use. Moreover, most members were more familiar with MySQL making operating with it better for the group.

1.5.6. Frontend
We used React for developing our web application's frontend. Our main reason for using React is its user-friendly developing environment .Moreover, React is supported by a large community, providing developers with extensive documentation, guides, and helpful resources. Additionally, numerous third-party libraries and tools further facilitate the development of React projects. Finally, React's JSX syntax offers an HTML-like structure, enhancing code readability and comprehensibility. This boosted our productivity and ensured consistent coding practices throughout the project.

1.5.7. Mobile
Also, we used react-native for our mobile application. React Native is a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications, supported by a vast community and major industry players, resulting in a dynamic ecosystem and regularly updated libraries. Its component-based architecture allows for the modular development of mobile apps, ensuring reusability of components for cleaner and more maintainable code. This feauters of react-native have helped us a lot during the coding part of our mobile application.

1.5.8. Cloud Computer
We used DigitalOcean for our cloud computer. Thanks to DigitalOcean's 200$ gift card, we were able to rent a relatively good computer for running our application.

While merging [PR 406](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/pull/406) to the main, I have changed also table and repository class of portfolio, so there are conflicts because of the [PR 387](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/pull/387). I have solved the conflict from GitHub. Basically, choose the last changes and discard the older ones, and when convicts resolved, I have merged it with the main.

### Additional Information

- I have collaborated with Mesut Melih Akpƒ±nar and √ñmer Faruk Erzurumluoƒülu so many times. They are quite helpful because I have learned the tools, such as spring boot, or postman recently.
- I have firstly created the [PR 390](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/pull/390) but Melih merged it accidentally, so we have created a new [PR 406](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/pull/406)d with the same commits I have done in the [PR 390](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group10/pull/390) so that don‚Äô t confused about PR‚Äô s and the person who actually worked on it.
- For the portfolio endpoints, portfolio does not shown in the demo because at the last minute there was a connection error between frontend. So, it will be shown in the third milestone.
- I have learned a lot of useful tools and collaborate with my teammates. I have worked really hard but it worth.

### Additional Information

- In this project, I ensured the successful implementation of all tasks assigned to me, prioritizing timely and high-quality delivery. However, some challenges were encountered due to delays from the backend team in providing the required endpoints. Despite these setbacks, I proactively tested available APIs, provided detailed feedback to the backend team to facilitate their development process, and adapted my work to accommodate these delays without compromising the overall project timeline.

- I also played a key role in integrating third-party APIs like TradingView and Yahoo Finance, which were essential for the application's core functionalities. My responsibilities included not only front-end development but also effective communication and coordination with the backend team to ensure seamless integration of features.

- Additionally, I consistently reviewed pull requests from teammates, offering constructive feedback to improve code quality and maintain consistency throughout the project. My involvement extended beyond implementation, as I contributed to refining UI/UX elements, enhancing the user experience, and ensuring that the product met the project requirements and goals.
